# amlearn
Machine learning package for amorphous materials.

We integrate Fortran90 with Python (using f2py) to achieve combination the
flexibility and fast-computation (>10x times faster than pure Python) of features. Please see examples
in the SRO (short-range ordering) and MRO (medium-range ordering)
in the featurizers folder. The SRO and MRO representation are based on a recent
paper by Qi Wang and Anubhav Jain. (to be published).

Wrapper classes and useful utility functions for featurizers powered by matminer/amp and machine
learning algorithms supported by scikit-learn are also included.
